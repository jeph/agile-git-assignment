## [Why Every Software Engineer Should Write Articles](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-every-software-engineer-should-write-articles-f35bdae72d1b)

I think this article makes an interesting point about only truly understanding
something when you are able to explain it simply. I actually disagree with
this idea. I think it is perfectly feasible to understand something really 
well without being able to explain it simply. A lot of scientists in history
such as Kepler, were completely unintelligible but made great strides in our
understanding of the world. I think what makes learning how to explain 
something simply useful is the empathy it can teach. For example, if you
understand something super well, you might not question certain parts of
your understanding. Your understanding in these parts may be correct, 
however, you might not know why you understand a topic in this way. By
learning to explain it, you learn to empathize with someone who doesn't
think in the same way. I think it teaches you to be a better team player.
